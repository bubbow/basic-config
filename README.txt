These are my main config files, if you wish to use them.

You'll need (arch packages):
wofi pacmd paplay i3status sway ttf-fira-code kitty nm-applet grim slurp mako thunar swaybg

(ps: you dont really need thunar, fyi change the config to fit your needs ^_^)

keybinds!!!

mod+q = kill window
mod+z = floating
mod+enter = terminal
mod+d = wofi
mod+shift+r = thunar
mod+c = screenshot
everything else is the normal sway keybinds for the most part.

I probably missed stuff in the keybinds and the packages, if so let me know.  

AUR:
catppuccin-gtk-theme-macchiato (if you wish)

I recommend nwg-look for gtk theming

!!just two more things!!:
i recommend setting your timezone in the i3status config file. it is local by default but i'd do it incase (:
and set a backround at line 29 of the sway config file!

Thank you because I do not have the willpower to do everything one by one
